# iDeepViewLearn
We present iDeepViewLearn (Interpretable Deep Learning Method for Multi-view Learning)--a method for learning nonlinear  relationships of data from multiple views that is capable of feature ranking. iDeepViewLearn  combines the flexibility of deep learning  with the statistical advantages of data- and knowledge-driven feature selection, resulting in interpretable findings.  iDeepViewLearn  learns low-dimensional representations common to all views, approximates the views  by a nonlinear function of the shared low-dimensional representations, constructs an optimization problem that minimizes the sum of the differences between the observed and the reconstructed views, and imposes a regularization penalty on the reconstructed views, and thus permits reconstruction of the views based on only relevant features. Further, we use the normalized Laplacian of a graph to model bilateral relationships between variables in each view, thus encouraging the selection of variables that are connected.
